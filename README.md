I am a passionate Flutter Developer with over a year of hands-on experience building high-performance, user-centric mobile applications. With a solid background in both frontend and backend development, I specialize in designing intuitive interfaces, integrating robust APIs, and implementing real-time data management with Firebase. Leveraging Dart, Provider, and GetX, I build apps that are not only visually appealing but also scalable and efficient. My experience spans both iOS and Android platforms, and I have a deep commitment to delivering quality software solutions.
