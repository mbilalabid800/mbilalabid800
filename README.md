I'm a Flutter Developer with over a year of experience, dedicated to creating efficient, user-friendly mobile applications. My expertise lies in designing intuitive UIs, integrating APIs, and implementing real-time data solutions with Firebase. I manage state using Provider and GetX, write in Dart, and utilize Git for version control. In addition to my development skills, I bring strong attention to detail and client service, honed through completing over 1,000 video editing projects on Fiverr.
